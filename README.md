##  About Me  
I’m passionate about developing solutions that are not just functional — but reliable, clear, and built for growth.  
I approach every project as a system: from the UI to the backend to the database.  

• I prioritize modularity, code clarity, and data integrity.  
• I love working with data — designing robust models, building meaningful analytics, and turning information into insights.  
• I’m interested in contributing to **healthtech**, **national infrastructure**, **data platforms**, and **defense systems** — where code must be robust, secure, and thoughtful.
